      <p> The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the 
          day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. 
          These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul 
          and character of the person. Notable figures with day names include 
          Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah and former United Nations 
          Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Check out the 
          Wiki page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akan_names"> Akan Names</a>.</p>
